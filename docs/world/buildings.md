# SIGILRPG PLAYER GUIDE: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENERGY ECONOMY

## 📦 BASES & BUILDINGS — ENERGY COSTS AND OPERATIONS

In the SigilRPG universe, energy is currency. The infrastructure you build, own, or destroy is quantified in **Sparks** — the base energy unit (1 Spark = 10 MJ). Whether you're managing a survival outpost, operating a megafactory, or fueling a warship, every watt counts.

This guide outlines **daily energy costs** and **baseline requirements** for common structures and systems, grounded in realistic energy consumption models.

## ⚙️ OPERATIONAL NOTES

- **Power Grid Costs**: Add 5–15% overhead for network losses and capacitors.
- **Zenith Tech Upgrades**:
  - Reduces base cost by 20–30%, but requires rare fuel or high initial Spark investment.
- **Energy Taxes** (Urban Zones): 1–5% extra per day, enforced by local governance AIs.
