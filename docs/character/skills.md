## Overview

Skills represent a character’s knowledge, experience, training, and natural aptitude in specific areas.

- **Skill Check** = `d20 + Attribute Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if applicable)`
- **Training Levels**:
  - **Unskilled (0)** — No bonus.
  - **Proficient (1)** — Add proficiency modifier.
  - **Expertise (2)** — Add proficiency modifier twice.
- **Expertise** requires:
  - Level 5 **or** Intellect score ≥ 15
- Certain skills require unlocking through **Disciplines** at specific tiers.

A character’s total **skill points** are based on **Species** and **Intellect modifier**.

## Additional Notes

- Some skills are gated behind **Disciplines** and cannot be trained until specific **Tiers** are unlocked.
- Proficiency modifiers scale by **character level**.
- Character can train more skills outside of normal skill points, but a Neural Remap removes this progression.
