## Attributes - Innate talent
Each character is granted Attribute Array [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8] which may be
assigned in any combination to six character Attributes. These may be further 
improved with ASI - Attribute Score Improvements, which are granted when a
character unlocks a tier of Discipline. 

Attributes may be improved up to 20.
To increase attribute beyond 20, first, a character has to reach 
level 10 and have at least two attributes increased to 20. 
These six statistics represent raw possibilities and limits, independent of levels, training, and skills.

    Strength: Carry weight, Melee combat, Athletism

    Dexterity: Relfexes and Avoidance, Aiming, Initiative

    Constitution: Durability, Resistance, Biological might

    Intellect: Reasoning, Learning, Number of Skills

    Intuition: Instincts, Vision and Perception

    Presence: Charisma, Charm, Willpower

## Level & Tier - Acquired mastery
Levels go from 1 to 20, and increase as character gains more experience.
Tier of a character is based on the level, and represents a simplified grouping, useful when splitting the world and story.
Some mechanics of SigilRPG might interact with Tier instead of Level.

| Level | Tier | Discipline Points | Proficiency Bonus / Focus |
|-------|------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1     | I    | 2                 | +2 / 2                    |
| 2     | I    | 3                 | +2 / 2                    |

## Ascendancy - Power beyond
All-in-one tracker of extraordinary power.
A way to reach beyond your current power, narrative capstone to big character arc.
To gain Ascendency perk, character must be at the end of current tier progression,
or in terms of levels:

    Level 5 for Tier I: Enlightened
    Level 10 for Tier II: Awakened
    Level 15 for Tier III: Exalted
    Level 20 for Tier IV: Ascended

In SigilRPG, default perk is based on the species, but it might reflect specific events and plots.

## Disciplines - Perk Trees

Disciplines provide a way for a character to specialize and develop unusual abilities. 
Split into three subsections: Cunning, Mysticism, Prowess, each of them focuses on different features. 
They come in four tiers, each other tier available to higher level characters. 

TODO: Rework to interact with character tiers, "spec in" the discipline.
