## 🗡️ Attack Actions

Attacks in **SigilRPG** require **⚡ Focus** to perform and are characterized by:

- 🎯 **Accuracy** — chance to hit
- 💥 **Damage** — amount of harm dealt
- ☠️ **Lethality** — critical hit threat range

By default, a natural **20** on an Accuracy Throw is a critical hit.  
Each point of **Lethality** extends this range by 1 (e.g. Lethality +2 allows crits on 20, 19, and 18).
