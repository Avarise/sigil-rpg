### üîã AMMO & RELOADING

- **Hand Guns**: 10 shells per magazine, **1 Focus** to reload.
- **Rifles**: 6 shots total per magazine; **burst** counts as one attack regardless of number of targets hit.
- **Emiters**: Use **cartridges**, not traditional ammo. Quality of cartridge may boost damage or add status effects.
- **Bows**: No reload cost, but requires free hand for arrows unless using integrated mod.
- **Multitool Laser**: Has to cooldown for one whole round after dealing 10 - 40 damage (Based on device tier)

### üßæ NOTES

- *Sniper Mode* disables **sweep** or **multi-target** abilities, but allows attacks from afar with greater precision.
- All ranged attacks beyond effective range suffer **disadvantage** unless target is stationary or otherwise exposed.
- **Energy weapons** (like Emiter) may be affected by environmental conditions (e.g., water, magnetic interference).
