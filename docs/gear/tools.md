# SIGILRPG TOOL KITS ‚Äî FUNCTIONAL EQUIPMENT FOR SKILL USERS

In SigilRPG, tools are essential interfaces, kits, and modules that **enable skill usage** or significantly **enhance success rates** for actions related to a skill. Unlike D&D, tools are not separate proficiencies ‚Äî they **unlock or empower use of skills** in specific contexts.

Each toolset:
- Assumes modular compatibility with **Sigil-standard ports**
- Requires **appropriate environment** (e.g. pressurized, power access, or training)
- Has a listed **Spark Price**, based on complexity and manpower

## üõ†Ô∏è NOTES ON TOOL USE IN SIGILRPG

- Tools **don‚Äôt gate** your ability to make a check ‚Äî but **enable** checks in certain contexts (e.g. hacking a node without a Logic Kit imposes disadvantage).
- Some tools **reduce crafting DCs** or **increase action efficiency** (GM discretion).
- **Tool specialization** may provide advantage or unlock a unique use of the skill.
