Defensive gear in SigilRPG includes armor, suits, projectors, and shields.  
Each affects survivability, mobility, and stealth. Heavier plating adds **Damage Threshold (DT)**,
but imposes penalties to stealth and Dexterity bonuses.

## Note: The Fragility of Shields

Shields in SigilRPG are forged from the highest-grade alloys, rarer and costlier than most weapons. They grant a permanent **+2 AC** when carried, but they are not indestructible.

In battle, most attacks that ‚Äújust miss‚Äù are described as being deflected by a shield. This has no extra mechanical effect. However, when a strike lands *barely above your AC* (e.g., against AC 18: an attack roll of 19 or 20, but not a critical hit) the shield may be driven back into you by the force of the blow. In this rare case:

- If the attack **deals 20 damage or more**, the shield itself risks damage.  
- The defender immediately rolls any die:
- **Even result** ‚Üí The shield holds; no damage.  
- **Odd result** ‚Üí The shield is damaged.

A **damaged shield** still functions, but only grants **+1 AC**.  
If a damaged shield is damaged again, it **shatters**, becoming useless scrap.
This rule ensures that shields remain mighty tools of defense, but not eternal ones. When weapons unleash the vast energies of the far future, even the strongest metals may crack.
