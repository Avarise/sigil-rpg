# üß† Cybernetic Implants ‚Äî SigilRPG

Implants in SigilRPG are permanent cybernetic augmentations installed into the body. They require medical procedures, high-tech facilities, and are powered either biologically or via internal microreactors. Some offer passive benefits, others provide activated powers. Tiered versions may exist.

## üí° Notes

- All implants require surgery or professional installation.
- Some implants are mutually exclusive due to organ space or systemic load.
- A typical body supports 3‚Äì5 implants without drawbacks. Pushing beyond that may trigger **Overload**, requiring special traits or support systems.
